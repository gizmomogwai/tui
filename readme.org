** TODO
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43555398/correctly-processing-ctrl-c-when-using-poll

** Structure
- mainthread should construct the ui
- ctrl-c is handled by this library (unfortunately the signal handler
  uses an singleton)
- have a loop while not done that renders, gets input, handles input
